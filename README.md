## What is this?
This is a Discord bot designed for the Hy-Tech Club Capstone Discord 
server. Made purposefully to regulate counting originally, utilizes GitHub Actions, Docker, and Fly.io for continuous deployment. 😊

Features:
* Extremely customizable dynamic message system
* Tracks all messages in a specific channel
* Provides personality to your server
* Moderates unwanted messages and responds dynamically

**Super easy to add your own messages, follow the format in `messages.json`!**

#### Uses:
> **Fly.io, NodeJS, Discord's API, JavaScript**

## Why?
Within the Capstone Discord server this was originally built for, 
we needed a way to regulate a channel users were supposed to sequentially
count in. Enter Shame Bot!

I enjoy working with Discord's API, and when the idea was floated about a bot
that could regulate unwanted messages automatically, I jumped on it. Since then,
new messages have been added, and Shame Bot has become extremely well liked in
its original community 😊

I will eventually hook it up to a database and make it more customizable by admins
without having to go through code.
